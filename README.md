# NovelPostProcessingForBPL
The file FactorGraphSetL32.mat stores 32 permuations of factor graph, which is selected by the probability error of factor graph.
And, These permutations have been sorted by ascending. 
The construction method is based on the paper "On the Decoding of Polar Codes on Permuted Factor Graphs".

==================================================================================================================

We propose a two-level detection formula and its corresponding post-processing method to improve the performance of BPL decoding. 

see paper "A Novel Post-Processing Method for BPL decoding of Polar Codes" submit to IEEE Communication Letter, 2021.1.12
