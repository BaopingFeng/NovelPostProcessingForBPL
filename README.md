# NovelPostProcessingForBPL
==================================================================================================================
The folder FactorGraphSet includes two files of factor graph set, which contains the code lenght N = 1024 and N = 128,respectively. 

The two files are FactorGraphSetN128L32.mat and FactorGraphSetN1024L32.mat. 

The file FactorGraphSetN128L32.mat and FactorGraphSetN1024L32.mat store 32 permuations of factor graph, which are selected by the probability error of factor graph in BP decoding.

Besides, these permutations have been sorted by ascending of the error probability. 

The construction method is based on the paper "On the Decoding of Polar Codes on Permuted Factor Graphs". 
N. Doan, S. A. Hashemi, M. Mondelli and W. J. Gross, "On the Decoding of Polar Codes on Permuted Factor Graphs," in Proc. of the IEEE Global Commun. Conf.(GLOBECOM), Dec. 2018.

We propose a two-level detection formula and its corresponding post-processing method to improve the performance of BPL decoding. 

see paper "A Novel Post-Processing Method for BPL decoding of Polar Codes" submit to IEEE Communication Letter.
